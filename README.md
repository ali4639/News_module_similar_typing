New module similar to typing </br>
I am Ali Azarban, senior expert in software engineering from Islamic Azad University, Urmia Branch, Iran.
In this tutorial, I have designed a module that is usually placed at the top position of the website or usually after the website navigation and shows the news and important events of the website in typed form. This module is mostly used in news websites and the need for it is felt more. I hope you download the files and source codes and use them and enjoy and update the files wherever you need.
Thanks to all of you
